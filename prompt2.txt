Debbuging prompts: 1. im getting this error feedback and im abit confused on what it means, lets go step by step to debug this issue:
Answer: The error ECONNREFUSED indicates that your application is unable to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This usually happens for a few common reasons:
PostgreSQL server might not be running
The port number in your .env file doesn't match your PostgreSQL server's port
Incorrect credentials in the .env file
Let's fix this:
First, verify that PostgreSQL is running on your machine. You can do this by:
On Windows: Check Services app for "PostgreSQL"
On Mac/Linux: Run ps aux | grep postgres
The standard PostgreSQL port is 5432, but your .env file shows 5435. Let's modify the .env file.
// the problem was the port number in the .env file
